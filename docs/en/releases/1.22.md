Release date: TBA

::: info NOTE
**This is a preview work-in-progress release, which may have breaking changes introduced at any time.** Choose it if you're in the early development stages or need a specific feature unavailable in the stable release. Note that preview releases are not published on Unity's Asset Store and have to be [installed from GitHub](/guide/getting-started#install-from-github).
:::

## Compatibility

Supported Unity versions: `6.3` and `TBA` LTS releases (with the latest patches).

Non-LTS (tech, beta, and alpha) releases are not supported. Any issues with future Unity releases will be addressed in the next Naninovel versions. Compatible Unity releases for past Naninovel versions are listed in the [release notes](https://naninovel.com/releases).

## Upgrade Guide

When upgrading a project with Naninovel version 1.20 or older, first follow the [v1.21 release](/releases/1.21) upgrade guide, then continue with the following instructions:

1. Back up the project or use a [VCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) to be able to roll back in case something goes wrong.
2. In case using [VS Code extension](/guide/ide-extension), update both the extension and VS Code itself to the latest versions.
3. Install the new release. [<sup>[doc]</sup>](/guide/getting-started#install-from-github)
4. Run the upgrade script via `Naninovel/Upgrade/v1.21 to v1.22` Unity editor menu.

## Added

- Added inline comments. [<sup>[doc]</sup>](/guide/scenario-scripting#comment-lines)
- It's now possible to use whitespace in values without wrapping, eg: `@set a=1, b=2`.
- Added expression operator aliases. [<sup>[doc]</sup>](/guide/script-expressions#operator-aliases)
- Added [@or] command, which works as a shortcut to `@else if:...`.

## Changed

- The minimum-supported Unity version changed to `6.3`.
- Removed the legacy script graph and visual scenario editor (use [story editor](/guide/editor) instead).
- Removed the legacy `@animate` command (use [@async] instead).
- Changed assignment expression separator from `;` to `,` (semicolon is now used by inline comments); use the upgrade script to automatically upgrade scripts.

## Fixed

Most fixes associated with bugs found during the pre-release stage are backported to the previous stable release and are not listed here; find them at the "Patches" section of the previous release changelog.
