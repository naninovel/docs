# Introduction

Naninovel is an extension for the [Unity game engine](https://unity3d.com), featuring a suite of authoring tools for scenario writers and a C# framework for developers, designed to streamline the creation of narrative-driven content, from in-game dialogues and cutscenes to full-fledged [visual novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel).

::: info NOTE
While Naninovel doesn't limit what you can achieve with Unity, some built-in features have specific requirements (supported Unity versions, project configuration, target platforms) to work correctly. Consult the [compatibility page](/guide/compatibility) for more information.

This online documentation is the primary official reference, kept up to date with engine changes. Scenario writers should start with the [getting started](/guide/getting-started) and [scenario scripting](/guide/scenario-scripting) guides, while developers are encouraged to read the "Developer" section as well. The "Advanced" section focuses on the C# framework and is recommended when integrating Naninovel into existing codebases or when deeper extension and customization are required.
