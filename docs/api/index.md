# Commands

Script commands API reference. Use the side bar to quickly navigate between available commands. 

~~Strikethrough~~ indicates a nameless parameter, and **bold** stands for required parameter; other parameters should be considered optional. Consult [naninovel scripts guide](/guide/naninovel-scripts) in case you have no idea what's this all about.

The following parameters are supported by most script commands:

<div class="config-table">

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| if | string |  A boolean [script expression](/guide/script-expressions), controlling whether the command should execute. |
| unless | string |  A boolean [script expression](/guide/script-expressions), controlling whether the command should NOT execute (inverse of 'if'). |
| wait | boolean | Whether the script player should wait for the async command to finish execution before executing the next one. |

</div>

## append

Appends specified text to a text printer.

::: info NOTE
The entire text is appended instantly, without triggering the reveal effect.
:::

<div class="config-table">

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <span class="command-param-nameless command-param-required" title="Nameless parameter: value should be specified after the command identifier without specifying parameter ID  Required parameter: parameter should always be specified">text</span> | string | The text to append. |
| printer | string | ID of the printer actor to use. Will use a default one when not specified. |
| author | string | ID of the actor, which should be associated with the appended text. |

</div>

```nani
; Print first part of the sentence as usual (with gradual reveal),
; then append the end of the sentence at once.
Lorem ipsum
@append " dolor sit amet."
```

## arrange

Arranges specified characters by X-axis. When no parameters specified, will execute an auto-arrange evenly distributing visible characters by X-axis.

<div class="config-table">

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <span class="command-param-nameless" title="Nameless parameter: value should be specified after the command identifier without specifying parameter ID">characterPositions</span> | named decimal list | A collection of character ID to scene X-axis position (relative to the left scene border, in percents) named values. Position 0 relates to the left border and 100 to the right border of the scene; 50 is the center. |
| look | boolean | When performing auto-arrange, controls whether to also make the characters look at the scene origin (enabled by default). |
| time | decimal | Duration of the animation initiated by the command, in seconds. |
| wait | boolean | Whether to wait for the command to finish before starting executing next command in the scenario script. Default behaviour is controlled by `Wait By Default` option in the script player configuration. |

</div>

```nani
; Evenly distribute all the visible characters.
@arrange

; Place character with ID 'Jenna' 15%, 'Felix' 50% and 'Mia' 85% away
; from the left border of the scene.
@arrange Jenna.15,Felix.50,Mia.85
```

## async

Executes the nested lines asynchronously on a dedicated script track in parallel with the main scenario playback routine. Use to run composite animations or arbitrary command chains concurrently with the consequent scenario. Consult the [concurrent playback](/guide/naninovel-scripts#concurrent-playback) guide for more info.

<div class="config-table">

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <span class="command-param-nameless" title="Nameless parameter: value should be specified after the command identifier without specifying parameter ID">asyncId</span> | string | Unique identifier of the player track and associated async task responsible for executing the nested lines. When specified, the ID can be used to [@await] or [@stop] the async task execution. |
| loop | boolean | Whether to execute the nested lines in a loop, until stopped with [@stop]. |

</div>

```nani
; Pan the camera slowly across three points.
@async CameraPan
    @camera offset:4,1 zoom:0.5 time:3 wait!
    @camera offset:,-2 zoom:0.4 time:2 wait!
    @camera offset:0,0 zoom:0 time:3 wait!
; The text below prints while the animation above runs independently.
...
; Before modifying the camera again, make sure the pan animation is finished.
@await CameraPan
@camera zoom:0.7

; Run the 'Quake' async task in a loop.
@async Quake loop!
    @spawn Pebbles
    @shake Camera
    @wait random(3,10)
...
; Stop the task.
@stop Quake
```

## await

Holds script execution until all the nested async commands finished execution. Useful for grouping multiple async commands to wait until they all finish before proceeding with the script playback.

::: info NOTE
The nested block is expected to always finish; don't nest any commands that could navigate outside the nested block, as this may cause undefined behaviour.
:::

```nani
; Run nested lines in parallel and wait until they all are finished.
@await
    @back RainyScene
    @bgm RainAmbient
    @camera zoom:0.5 time:3
    It starts Raining...[< skip!]
; Following line will execute after all the above is finished.
...
```

## back

Modifies a [background actor](/guide/backgrounds).

::: info NOTE
Backgrounds are handled a bit differently from characters to better accommodate traditional VN game flow.  Most of the time you'll probably have a single background actor on scene, which will constantly transition to different appearances. To remove the hassle of repeating same actor ID in scripts, it's possible to provide only  the background appearance and transition type (optional) as a nameless parameter assuming `MainBackground`  actor should be affected. When this is not the case, ID of the background actor can be explicitly specified via the `id` parameter.
:::

<div class="config-table">

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <span class="command-param-nameless" title="Nameless parameter: value should be specified after the command identifier without specifying parameter ID">appearanceAndTransition</span> | named string | Appearance (or [pose](/guide/backgrounds#poses)) to set for the modified background and type of a [transition effect](/guide/transition-effects) to use.

## gosub

Navigates naninovel script playback to the specified path and saves that path to global state; [@return] commands use this info to redirect to command after the last invoked gosub command.

::: info NOTE
While this command can be used as a function (subroutine) to invoke a common set of script lines, remember that NaniScript is a scenario scripting DSL and is not suited for general programming. It's strongly recommended to use [custom commands](/guide/custom-commands) instead.

## remove

Removes (disposes) actors (character, background, text printer, choice handler) with the specified IDs. In case multiple actors with the same ID found (eg, a character and a printer), will affect only the first found one.

::: info NOTE
By default, Naninovel automatically removes unused actors when unloading script resources; only use this command when `Remove Actors` is disabled in resource provider configuration or when you need to force-dispose an actor at specific moment. Consult [memory management](/guide/memory-management#actor-resources) guide for more info.

## trans

Performs scene transition masking the real scene content with anything that is visible at the moment the command starts execution (except the UI), executing nested commands to change the scene and finishing with specified [transition effect](/guide/transition-effects).<br/><br/> The command works similar to actor appearance transitions, but covers the whole scene. Use it to change multiple actors and other visible entities to a new state in a single batch with a transition effect.

::: info NOTE
The UI will be hidden and user input blocked while the transition is in progress (nested commands are running). You can change that by overriding the `ISceneTransitionUI`, which handles the transition process.<br/><br/> Async nested commands will execute immediately, w/o the need to specify `time:0` for each.<br/><br/> The nested block is expected to always finish; don't nest any commands that could navigate outside the nested block, as this may cause undefined behaviour.
