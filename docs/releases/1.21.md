# 1.21 Release Notes

Release date: Q4 2025 (ETA)

::: info NOTE
**This is a preview work-in-progress release, which may have breaking changes introduced at any time.** Choose it if you're in the early development stages or need a specific feature unavailable in the stable release. Note that preview releases are not published on Unity's Asset Store and have to be [installed from GitHub](/guide/getting-started#install-from-github).
:::

## Compatibility

Supported Unity versions range: `6000.0.50 - 6000.2`

Only LTS releases in the range are supported. Any issues with the future Unity releases will be addressed in the next Naninovel releases. Compatible Unity versions for past releases are specified in the [release notes](https://pre.naninovel.com/releases).

## Upgrade Guide

When upgrading a project with Naninovel version 1.18 or older, first follow the [v1.19 release](/releases/1.19) upgrade guide, then continue with the following instructions:

1. Back up the project or use a [VCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) to be able to roll back in case something goes wrong.
2. In case using [VS Code extension](/guide/ide-extension), update both the extension and VS Code itself to the latest versions.
3. Install the new release. [<sup>[doc]</sup>](/guide/getting-started#install-from-github)
4. Run the upgrade script via `Naninovel/Upgrade/v1.20 to v1.21` Unity editor menu.
5. If you've customized the built-in save-load UI, revisit the prefab, as it now has an additional "AUTO" tab.
6. [@choice] commands now stop playback automatically; if you have cases where something other than [@stop] follows the choice block, add `skip!` to the last choice to restore the previous behavior.
7. Choice buttons are now always loaded via the `Choice Button Loader` specified in the choice handler configuration menu, and should be stored in the `Resources/Naninovel/ChoiceButtons` folder. Alternatively, you can configure a different resource provider in the loader settings, for example to use Addressables.


## Added

- Added relative and wildcard endpoint syntaxes allowing to simplify navigation paths. [<sup>[doc]</sup>](/guide/naninovel-scripts#endpoint-syntax)
- Added lazy resource policy mode. [<sup>[doc]</sup>](/guide/memory-management#lazy-policy)
- Added [@unless] command and `unless` parameter for all commands, which work as the logical inverse to [@if] command and `if` parameter respectively.
- Added default assignment operator `?=` allowing to declare and assign variable only in case it's not already assigned. [<sup>[doc]</sup>](/guide/custom-variables#default-assignment)
- Eased control flow exit requirements: [@stop] commands are no longer required to gracefully terminate control flow; also, it is now allowed for nested blocks to not have exit lines.
- Added a dedicated "Keyboard" input mode with the associated control legend for better accessibility.
- Printer character commands (`Char Commands` property of the `Revealable Text Printer Panel` component found on the printer prefabs) are now awaited allowing to use [@wait] commands to control the reveal process.
- Added "AUTO" save-load tab; [@save] now saves to the auto tab instead of the quick-save tab.
- Added `Auto Save On Quit` option to state configuration (enabled by default); when enabled, then game will auto-save to the newly added "AUTO" tab before exiting to title or when the application is quit.
- Text of `Toast UI` ([@toast] command) is now updated on locale change.
- Added `Expose Source Locale` option to the localization configuration (enabled by default). When disabled, the source locale won't be available for the end-users (players). [<sup>[doc]</sup>](/guide/localization)
- Added `loop` parameter to [@shake] command allowing to enable/disable continuous shake effect instead of using `count:0` and `count:-1`.
- Added `at` parameter to [@save] command allowing to redirect the player position after the saved game is loaded.
- Added script reference helper, which simplifies referencing script assets in a stable manner. [<sup>[doc]</sup>](/guide/integration-options#script-asset-reference)
- Added `LastGameState` property to state manager providing access to the last de-/serialized game state.
- Added filtering for locale-specific fonts so that they're not included to the font selection in game settings.
- Improved nesting diagnostic in VS Code–it know indicates the extra indentation in the affected line and clearly states the reason for the warning.
- Added an option to refresh script resource paths. [<sup>[demo]</sup>](https://i.gyazo.com/dc0a4fbd934ce621677162116f5f582e.mp4)
- Improved error when missing a localization document–it now points to the specific missing resource and locale.
- Added `VirtualResourceProvider` option to the resource loaders configuration allowing to add resources at runtime.
- Added `[Command.Group]` attribute allowing to assign a category to script command; used by standalone editor to group the commands and associate them with icons.
- Improved hot reload stability and fixed several edge cases which caused inconsistent behavior.
- Hot reload is now available at runtime via `reload` console command and `IHotReload` engine service.
- Made most built-in UIs pixel-perfect to prevent pixel alignment issues when running outside of the native resolution.
- [@input] command will now automatically pull predefined value in case the assigned variable already has a value.
- [@choice] and [@input] commands no longer require adding [@stop] to halt script playback until the user interaction is committed. In case a playback halt is not required, use the added `skip` parameter.
- Added condition context to `lock` parameter of [@choice] allowing to assign expression without wrapping the value in curly braces.
- It's now possible to use boolean flags with parameters of the expression context.
- Spreadsheet tool is no longer limited by 32KB CSV line size when importing the localization.
- Added `ExpressionEvaluator.Context` property allowing to access the context of the evaluated expressions in the associated C# methods.

## Changed

- Min. supported Unity version changed to 6.0.
- Changed label delimiter from `.` to `#` to support the new relative endpoint syntax; use `Naninovel/Upgrade/v1.20 to v1.21` tool in Unity editor menu to automatically upgrade the scripts.
- Layered actors no longer attempt to align an underlying game object with the render texture, as that was causing rendering issues. Perfect alignment is not possible anyway due to render effects, such as look direction flipping. When the alignment is required, use generic or custom implementations.
- Command attribute `[Command.CommandAlias]` renamed to `[Command.Alias]`, parameter attribute `[Command.PrameterAlias]` removed—use `[Command.Alias]` instead.
- Removed Google Drive resource provider; use Local Provider pointing to a directory synced with Google Drive (or other similar services) instead.
- [@input] and [@choice] commands will now auto-halt the playback, so you no longer have to add [@stop] after them. For backward compatibility [@stop] after the commands is a no-op. `play` parameter in the commands is replaced with `skip` to allow disabling the auto-halt.
- Changed the type of `lock` parameter of [@choice] to string with condition context to allow assigning expression without wrapping the value in curly braces.
- [@save] command now writes to the newly added "AUTO" tab instead of the quick-save tab.
- Choice buttons are now always load via the `Choice Button Loader` specified in the choice handler configuration menu (previously they'd fall back to `Resources.Load` method when loading failed).

## Fixed

Most fixes associated with bugs found during the pre-release stage are backported to the previous stable release and are not listed here; find them at the "Patches" section of the previous release changelog.

- Fixed `ICustomVariableManager.OnVariableUpdated` event not invoked on game load and rollback.
- Fixed parameter values without whitespace has wrapping quotes removed when formatting with VS Code or with stable identifier in Unity.
- Fixed layered actors clipping when scaled and the local position is not balanced.
- Fixed warnings on hot reload after editing a line before the currently played one.
- Fixed video resources failing to load in WebGL build when addressable system is not installed.
- Fixed video resources duplicated in WebGL build when addressable system is installed.
- Fixed [@await] command waiting for all the currently played commands instead of only the nested ones.
- Fixed [@trans] command completing all the currently played commands instead of only the nested ones.
- Fixed custom [@choice] buttons failing to load when the path is dynamic (specified with an expression).
