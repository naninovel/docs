# Sandbox

Sandbox is a special Naninovel WebGL build that you can use to try out the engine features before purchasing Naninovel on the Asset Store. It uses [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive) as a remote resources provider, which you can use to store the in-game resources (character sprites, backgrounds, music, etc) and write naninovel scripts using [Google Documents](https://www.google.com/docs/about).

## How to Use

A Google Drive account is required to use the sandbox. You can get one for free at [google.com/drive](https://www.google.com/drive).

Proceed to [naninovel.com/sandbox/web](https://naninovel.com/sandbox/web.html) to load the WebGL build. Upon first start it'll ask to authorize with a Google account; select account connected with the Google Drive you wish to use with the sandbox. If you're concerned about safety of your drive, create a new drive account to use with the sandbox.

After authorization, you'll be redirected back to the app. Press `HOW TO USE` button and then `UPLOAD DATA` to create a `NaninovelSandbox` folder in the root of your Google Drive along with a set of sub-folders to store naninovel scripts, characters, backgrounds and audio assets; `readme.txt` files will also be uploaded inside each of the sub-folders explaining how to add the resources and use them in naninovel scripts.

After uploading the data navigate to your Google Drive, drop the required resources to the corresponding sub-folders and write naninovel scripts using Google Documents (documents should be created in the `Scripts` sub-folder). Return to the app, refresh the page and select created naninovel scripts to play.
