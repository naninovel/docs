# Movies

Movies are videos played on top of the scene via `IMovieUI` UI, halting script execution and user input processing while being played.

Before starting playing a movie a fade-in to the specified fade texture (solid black by default) is performed. When playback is finished, a fade-out from the fade texture to the scene content is performed.

Player can skip movie playback with a `SkipMovie` input (`Esc` by default for standalone input module); binding can be changed in input configuration menu.

To add, edit and remove movie resources use the movie manager accessible via `Naninovel -> Resources -> Movies` context menu:

You can use any video formats [supported by Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/VideoSources-FileCompatibility).

Movies playback behavior can be configured using `Naninovel -> Configuration -> Movies` editor menu; for available options see [configuration guide](/guide/configuration#movies).

Use [@movie] command followed by video clip name to play a movie from the naninovel scripts:

```nani
; Given an "Opening" video clip is added to the movie resources, play it.
@movie Opening
```

By default, played video is fitted to 16:9 aspect ratio to prevent stretching. You can change this behavior by [overriding](/guide/user-interface.html#ui-customization) `IMovieUI` UI. `Aspect Ratio Fitter` component attached to `MovieImage` game object controls the fitting behavior.

## WebGL Limitations

Due to platform limitations, video playback on WebGL possible only in URI streaming mode. When building WebGL player, all the movie resources will automatically be copied to `Assets/StreamingAssets` directory. Make sure your web hosting is configured to allow local file access from the player build directory.

If you're using a video format other than mp4 (eg, webm), set the extension of the hosted files via `Video Stream Extension` property in the resource provider configuration.
