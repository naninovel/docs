# Save-Load System

Game can be saved and loaded at any time by using save and load menus. User can select a save slot to use and delete any previously used slot.

Menu UIs can be customized or completely replaced using [UI Customization](/guide/user-interface#ui-customization) feature.

Save slots are serialized to either `.json` or binary files (depending on the configuration). File names, slot limit and directory name can be configured using `Naninovel -> Configuration -> State` context menu; for available options see [configuration guide](/guide/configuration#state).
