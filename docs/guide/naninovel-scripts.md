# Naninovel Scripts

Naninovel scripts are text documents (`.nani` extension) where you control what happens on scenes. Script assets are created with `Create -> Naninovel -> Naninovel Script` asset context menu. You can open and edit them with the built-in [visual editor](#visual-editor) or with an external text editor of your choice, like Microsoft Word, Google Docs or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

![](https://i.gyazo.com/f552c2ef323f9ec1171eba72e0c55432.png)

Each line in naninovel script represents a statement, which can be a command, generic text, label or comment. Type of the statement is determined by the literal placed at the start of the line:

| Literal | Statement Type            |
|:-------:|---------------------------|
|    @    | [Command](#command-lines) |
|    #    | [Label](#label-lines)     |
|    ;    | [Comment](#comment-lines) |

When none of the above literals are present at the start of the line, it's considered a [generic text](#generic-text-lines) statement.

::: tip
It's possible to change all the pre-defined compiler artifacts, such as control characters, command identifiers, constants and basically anything you ever have to type while authoring scripts via [compiler localization](/guide/localization#compiler-localization) feature.
:::

## Command Lines

Line is considered a command statement if it starts with `@` literal. Command represents a single operation, that controls what happens on the scene; eg, it can be used to change a background, move a character or load another naninovel script.

### Command Identifier

Right after the command literal a command identifier is expected. This could either be a name of the C# class that implements the command or the command's alias (when applied via `Alias` attribute).

For example, [@save] command (used to auto-save the game) is implemented via `AutoSave` C# class. The implementing class also has `[Alias("save")]` attribute applied, so you can use both `@save` and `@AutoSave` statements in the script to invoke this command.

Command identifiers are case-insensitive; all the following statements are valid and will invoke the same `AutoSave` command:

```nani
@save
@Save
@AutoSave
@autosave
```

### Command Parameters

Most of the commands have a number of parameters that define the effect of the command. Parameter is a key-value expression defined after the command literal separated by a column (`:`). Parameter identifier (key) can be either name of the corresponding parameter field of the command implementation class or the parameter's alias (when defined via `alias` property of `CommandParameter` attribute).

```nani
@commandId paramId:paramValue
```

Consider [@hideChars] command, which is used to hide all visible characters on the scene. It can be used as follows:

```nani
@hideChars
```

You can use `time` *Decimal* parameter here to control how long the characters will fade-out before becoming completely hidden (removed from scene):

```nani
@hideChars time:5.5
```

This will make the characters fade-out for 5.5 seconds, before completely removing them from scene.

### Parameter Value Types

Depending on the command parameter, it can expect one of the following value types:

| Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| string  | A simple string value, eg: `LoremIpsum`. Don't forget to wrap the string in double quotes in case it contain spaces, eg: `"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet."`.                                                                                              |
| integer | A number which is not a fraction; a whole number, eg: `1`, `150`, `-25`.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| decimal | A decimal number with fraction delimited by a dot, eg: `1.0`, `12.08`, `-0.005`.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| boolean | Can have one of two possible values: `true` or `false`. In most cases you can use [boolean flags](/guide/naninovel-scripts#boolean-flags) instead of typing "true" and "false", eg: `@camera ortho! !wait` instead of `@camera ortho:true wait:false`. |
| named   | A name string associated with a value of one of the above types. The name part is delimited by a dot. Eg for named integer: `foo.8`, `bar.-20`.                                                                                                        |
| list    | A comma-separated list of values of one of the above types. Eg for string list: `foo,bar,"Lorem ipsum."`, for decimal list: `12,-8,0.105,2`                                                                                                            |

### Nameless Parameters

Most commands have a nameless parameter. A parameter is considered nameless when it can be used without specifying its name.

For example, [@bgm] command expects a nameless parameter specifying name of the music track to play:

```nani
@bgm PianoTheme
```

"PianoTheme" here is the value of "BgmPath" *String* parameter.

There can be only one nameless parameter per command and it should always be specified before any other parameters.

### Optional and Required Parameters

Most of the command parameters are *optional*. It means they either have a predefined value or just don't require any value in order for the command to be executed. For example, when [@resetText] command is used without specifying any parameters it will reset text of a default printer, but you can also set a specific printer ID like this: `@resetText printer:Dialogue`.

Some parameters however are *required* in order for the command to execute and should always be specified.

### Commands API Reference

For the list of all the currently available commands with a summary, parameters and usage examples see [commands API reference](/api/).

## Comment Lines

When line starts with semicolon literal (`;`) it's considered a comment statement. Comment lines are completely ignored by the engine when scripts are parsed. Use comment lines to add notes or annotations for yourself or other team members working with naninovel scripts.

```nani
; The following command will auto-save the game.
@save
```

We will use comment lines in the rest of the guide to annotate sample NaniScript snippets.

## Generic Text Lines

To make writing scripts with large amounts of text easier generic text lines are used. Line is considered a generic text statement when it doesn't start with any of the predefined statement literals:

```nani
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
```

An author ID can be specified at the start of a generic text line separated by a column followed with space (`: `) to associate printed text with a [character actor](/guide/characters):

```nani
Felix: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
```

To save some typing when constantly changing character appearances associated with printed text, you can also specify appearance after the author ID:

```nani
Felix.Happy: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
```

The above line is equal to the following two:

```nani
@char Felix.Happy
Felix: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
```

### Command Inlining

Sometimes, you may want to execute a command while revealing (printing) text message, right after or before specific character. For example, an actor would change their appearance (expression) when a specific word is printed or a particular sound effect would be played in reaction to some event described in the midst of a printed message. Command inlining feature allows handling cases like that.

All the commands (both [built-in](/api/) and [custom ones](/guide/custom-commands)) can be inlined (injected) to generic text lines using square brackets (`[ ]`):

```nani
Felix: Lorem ipsum[char Felix.Happy pos:0.75] dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.[i] Aenean tempus eleifend ante, ac molestie metus condimentum quis.[i][br 2] Morbi nunc magna, consequat posuere consectetur in, dapibus consectetur lorem. Duis consectetur semper augue nec pharetra.
```

Notice, that the inlined command syntax is exactly the same, except `@` literal is omitted and command body is wrapped in square brackets. Basically, you can take any command line, inline it to a generic text and it will have the exact same effect, but at a different moment, depending on the position inside text message.

Under the hood, generic text lines are parsed into individual commands identified by inline index; text is printed with [@print] command. For example, following generic text line:

```nani
Lorem ipsum[char Felix.Happy pos:75 wait!] dolor sit amet.
```

— is actually handled by the engine as a sequence of individual commands:

```nani
@print "Lorem ipsum" !waitInput
@char Felix.Happy pos:75 wait!
@print " dolor sit amet." !reset
```

To actually print square brackets within generic text line, escape them with backslashes, eg:

```nani
Some text \[ text inside brackets \]
```

— will print "Some text [ text inside brackets ]" in-game.

### Generic Parameters

In some cases you may look to modify or assign [@print] parameters for specific parts or the whole generic text line. Use special command `<`, available only in generic lines, which will do just that:

```nani
; After printing following line waiting for input won't activate
; (player won't have to confirm prompt to continue reading).
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.[< skip!]

; Following line will be authored by Kohaku and Yuko actors, while
; the display name label on the printer will show 'All Together'.
Kohaku,Yuko: How low hello![< as:"All Together"]

; First part of the sentence will be printed with 50% speed,
; while the second one with 250% speed and wait for input won't activate.
Lorem ipsum[< speed:0.5] dolor sit amet.[< speed:2.5 skip!]
```

The command will apply specified parameters to the last text line placed before the command, no matter if other commands are inlined between the `<` and text:

```nani
; The speed will still be applied to "Lorem ipsum" part, even
; though the parameters are placed after [i] inlined command.
Lorem ipsum[i][< speed:0.5] dolor sit amet.
```

### White Space Delimiters

In cases, when generic text line starts or ends with a white space (eg, tab or space), it could be useful to explicitly delimit where the content intended to be printed actually start or ends. Especially so, when using nesting.

Use `[]` (empty inlined command) as the delimiter of generic text line boundaries:

```nani
; Print "Some text  continuation." (with 2 spaces between)
@group
    ; Ensure white space at the end is preserved.
    Some text []
    ; Ensure white space at the start is preserved.
    [] continuation.[< join!]
```

## Label Lines

Labels are used as "anchors" when navigating Naninovel scripts with [@goto] commands. To define a label, use the `#` literal at the start of the line followed by the label name:

```nani
# Epilogue
```

You can then use the [@goto] command to "jump" to that line:

```nani
@goto ScriptPath#Epilogue
```

When both the [@goto] command and the target label are in the same script, you can omit the script path:

```nani
@goto #Epilogue
```

### Scenario Root

The "anchors" you specify with navigation commands are called *endpoints*. An endpoint consists of two parts: *script path* and *label*. The label is optional, and when omitted, the endpoint is assumed to point to the start of the script. The script path refers to the Naninovel scenario file's path (without the `.nani` extension), relative to the *scenario root*.

The scenario root is the root ancestor directory where all the scenario files are stored in the project. For example, consider the following directory structure of a Unity project:

```
Assets
└── Scenario/
    ├── Prologue.nani
    ├── CommonRoute/
    │   ├── Day1/
    │   │   ├── Scene1.nani
    │   │   └── Scene2.nani
    │   └── Day2/
    │       └── Scene1.nani
    └── RouteX/
        └── SceneX.nani
```

In this case, the scenario root is the `Assets/Scenario` directory. To navigate to the "Assets/Scenario/RouteX/SceneX.nani" script file, you'd use the following endpoint: `RouteX/SceneX`.

::: tip
If you don't like the idea of including directories when specifying endpoints—you don't have to! Check the [relative](/guide/naninovel-scripts#relative-endpoints) and [wildcard](/guide/naninovel-scripts#wildcard-endpoints) endpoint syntaxes explained below.
:::

The scenario root is detected automatically when you create or move scenario files. You can check the current root in Naninovel's script configuration menu.

![](https://i.gyazo.com/57515d699182ed09033e7284d1b58c46.png)

### Endpoint Syntax

Naninovel supports 4 flavors of endpoint syntax, allowing you to build more concise paths in some cases.

#### Canonical Endpoints

This is the default syntax, containing the full path to the script starting from the [scenario root](/guide/naninovel-scripts#scenario-root). It's always available and doesn't depend on the location of the current script, but it requires including all the directories up to the target script:

```nani
; Navigate to the start of the 'Assets/Scenario/Prologue.nani' script.
@goto Prologue
; Navigate to the 'Action' label in
; 'Assets/Scenario/CommonRoute/Day1/Scene1.nani' script.
@goto CommonRoute/Day1/Scene1#Action
```

#### Local Endpoints

This special syntax is available only when you're navigating to a label inside the current script. It doesn't contain the path to the scenario script, only the label:

```nani
; Navigate to 'Action' in the current script.
@goto #Action
```

#### Relative Endpoints

Relative paths are useful for simplifying the endpoint syntax by mapping paths relative to the current script:

```nani
; Given we're inside 'Assets/Scenario/CommonRoute/Day1/Scene1.nani',
; navigate to the 'Scene2.nani' file in the same directory.
@goto ./Scene2
; Navigate to the 'Scene1.nani' file inside a directory above the current one.
@goto ../Day2/Scene1
; Navigate to the 'SceneX.nani' file inside the 'RouteX' directory two
; levels above the current one.
@goto ../../RouteX/SceneX
```

#### Wildcard Endpoints

If you don't want to include directories in the paths at all, you can use wildcard paths where you specify just the script name. Be aware that this only works as long as the specified script name is unique—meaning there are no other script files with the same name in the project, regardless of their parent directories:

```nani
; Navigate to the 'Prologue.nani' script, no matter where it's located.
@goto */Prologue
; This will result in an error, because we have multiple 'Scene1.nani' files.
@goto */Scene1
; This will work, because there's only one 'Scene1.nani' file
; under the 'Day1' directory.
@goto */Day1/Scene1
```

## Boolean Flags

Use boolean flags as shortcuts for boolean parameter values, eg:

```nani
; Make Kohaku character visible.
@char Kohaku visible!
; Is equivalent to:
@char Kohaku visible:true

; Make Kohaku character invisible.
@char Kohaku !visible
; Is equivalent to:
@char Kohaku visible:false

; Inlined commands support the flags as well.
Lorem ipsum[shake Camera ver! !wait] dolor sit amet.
; Is equivalent to:
Lorem ipsum[shake Camera ver:true wait:false] dolor sit amet.
```

The only reasons to use full boolean form is when you want to evaluate the value dynamically via [script expression](/guide/script-expressions), eg:

```nani
; Make Kohaku visible if "score" variable is above 10.
@char Kohaku visible:{score>10}
```

— or when boolean parameter is nameless, eg:

```nani
; Disable camera look mode with nameless parameter.
@look false
```

Though in the latter case you can specify ID of the nameless parameter and still use it with boolean flag:

```nani
; Disable camera look mode with boolean flag.
@look !enable
```

## Conditional Execution

While the script are executed in a linear fashion by default, you can introduce branching using `if` parameters supported by all the commands.

```nani
; If `level` value is a number and is greater than 9000, add the choice.
@choice "It's over 9000!" if:level>9000

; If `dead` variable is a false boolean, execute the print command.
@print text:"I'm still alive." if:!dead

; If `glitch` is a true boolean or random function in 1 to 10 range
; returns 5 or more, execute `@spawn` command.
@spawn GlitchCamera if:"glitch || Random(1, 10) >= 5"

; If `score` value is in 7 to 13 range or `lucky` variable
; is a true boolean, load `LuckyEnd` script.
@goto LuckyEnd if:"(score >= 7 && score <= 13) || lucky"

; You can also use conditionals in the inlined commands.
Lorem sit amet. [style bold if:score>=10]Consectetur elit.[style default]

; When using double quotes inside the expression itself,
; don't forget to escape them.
@print {remark} if:remark=="Saying \"Stop the car\" was a mistake."
```

### Conditional Blocks

It's possible to [nest](/guide/naninovel-scripts#nesting) multiline conditional blocks under [@if] and [@else] commands:

```nani
; Print text line(s) depending on "score" variable:
;   "You've failed. Try again!" - when score is below 6.
;   "You've passed the test." and "Brilliant!" - when score is above 8.
;   "You've passed the test." and "Impressive!" - when score is above 7.
;   "You've passed the test." and "Good job!" - otherwise.
@if score>6
    You've passed the test.
    @if score>8
        Brilliant!
    @else if:score>7
        Impressive!
    @else
        Good job!
@else
    You've failed. Try again!
```

It's also possible to use conditional blocks inside generic text lines. Instead of indents, use [@endif] command to mark end of block:

```nani
; Print text line depending on "score" variable:
;   "Test result: Failed." - when score is below 6.
;   "Test result: Perfect!" - when score is above above 8.
;   "Test result: Passed." - otherwise.
Test result:[if score>8] Perfect![else if:score>6] Passed.[else] Failed.[endif]
```

To specify an inverse condition, use [@unless] command:

```nani
; Prints "You're still alive!" in case "dead" variable is false,
; otherwise prints "You're done.".
@unless dead
    You're still alive!
@else
    You're done.

; Print text line depending on "score" variable:
;   "Test result: Passed." - when score is 10 or above.
;   "Test result: Failed." - when score is below 10.
Test result:[unless score<10] Passed.[else] Failed.[endif]
```

:::

## Nesting

Commands such as [@if], [@choice], [@while] and several others support associating other commands and generic text lines with them via indentation:

```nani
@if score>10
    @bgm Victory
    Good job, you've passed the test!
```

— here [@bgm] command and following generic text line are associated with [@if] command.

Commands which support this feature are known as *nested hosts*; in C# such commands are distinguished by having `Command.INestedHost` interface implemented. Host commands are able to control which or whether nested commands are executed and in which order.

Each host command has its own behaviour when executing the nested commands. For example, [@if] will skip the nested commands when the specified condition is not met, while [@choice] will execute nested commands when (if) player pick associated choice:

```nani
@if score>10
    Good job, you've passed the test!
    @bgm Victory
    @spawn Fireworks
@else if:attempts>100
    You're hopeless... Need help?
    @choice "Yeah, please!"
        @set score+=10
        @goto #BeginTest
    @choice "I'll keep trying."
        @goto #BeginTest
    @stop
@else
    You've failed. Try again!
    @goto #BeginTest
```

Notice how nested blocks are indented: each indent level is exactly **4 spaces**. Tabs and indents with other space length will be ignored. Nested blocks of any level are possible: just indent deeper with the same 4 spaces.

Sometimes, you may need to group several commands under single host. For example, to execute a random block of commands with [@random]. In such cases, use [@group] command:

```nani
; Random command chooses one of the nested lines, but ignores children
; of its nested lines. Group command used here to group multiple lines,
; so that random command will actually execute multiple lines.
@random
    @group
        @back tint:red
        Paint it red.
    @group
        @back tint:black
        Paint it black.
```

## Async Execution

Some commands may execute over time. For example, [@hide] command will fade-out specified actor over the course of set time, which can be changed with `time` parameter. Consider following scenario:

```nani
@hide Kohaku
@show Yuko
```

— when played, you'll notice that Yuko actor would start fading-in at the same time Kohaku is faded-out. This is because, by default, all async commands are not awaited: `@show` will start fading-in Yuko right after `@hide` starts fading-out Kohaku.

If you'd like to wait for an async command to complete before proceeding with the playback, use `wait` parameter:

```nani
@hide Kohaku wait!
@show Yuko
```

— now Yuko will start fading-in only after Kohaku is completely faded-out.

It's common to specify multiple async commands to set up a scene and then wait until they all finish. To make the process simpler, use [@await] command:

```nani
; Run nested lines in parallel and wait until they all are finished.
@await
    @back RainyScene
    @bgm RainAmbient
    @camera zoom:0.5 time:3
    @print "It starts raining..." !waitInput
; Following line will execute after all the above is finished.
...
```

## Title Script

Title script is a special naninovel script assigned in script configuration menu. When assigned, it's automatically played when the title UI (main menu) is shown. Title script can be used to set up the title screen scene: background, music, effects, etc.

The script can also be used to invoke commands when player clicks "NEW GAME", "EXIT" or any of the save slots to load a game. Below is an example of a title script.

```nani
; Following commands are played when entering the main menu.
; Notice, they're not awaited so that title UI is shown at the same time.
@back MainMenuBackground time:3
@bgm MainMenuMusic
@spawn Rain
@stop

# OnNewGame
; Following commands will be executed when player clicks "NEW GAME".
; Notice, that `stopBgm` command is awaited, so that the music
; is fully stopped before new game begin to load.
@sfx NewGameSoundEffect
@stopBgm
@stop

# OnLoad
; Below commands will be executed when player loads a saved game.
@sfx LoadGameEffect
@wait 0.5
@stop

# OnExit
; Below commands will be executed when player clicks "EXIT".
@sfx ExitGameEffect
@wait 1.5
@stop

```

## Visual Editor

You can use visual script editor to edit the naninovel scripts. Select a script asset and you'll see the visual editor automatically open in the inspector window.

![](https://i.gyazo.com/ba57b9f78116e57408125325bdf66be9.mp4)

To add a new line to the script, either right-click the place, where you want to insert the line, or press `Ctrl+Space` (you can change the default key bindings in the input configuration menu) and select the desired line or command type. To re-order lines, drag them using their number labels. To remove a line, right-click it and choose "Remove".

When you've changed the script using visual editor, you'll see an asterisk (`*`) over the script path in the inspector header. That means the asset is dirty and need to be saved; press `Ctrl+S` to save the asset. In case you'll attempt to select another asset while the script is dirty, a dialogue window will pop-up allowing to either save or revert the changes.

The visual editor will automatically sync edited script if you update it externally, so you can seamlessly work with the scripts in both text and visual editors. In case auto-sync is not working, make sure `Auto Refresh` is enabled in the `Edit -> Preferences -> General` Unity editor menu.

During the playmode, you can use visual editor to track which script line is currently being played and use context menu (or click a line while holding `Shift`) to rewind the playback.

![](https://i.gyazo.com/b6e04d664ce4b513296b378b7c25be03.mp4)

Currently played line will be highlighted with green color; when script playback is halted due waiting for user input, played line will be highlighted with yellow instead.

You can tweak the editor behavior and looks in the scripts configuration menu.

## Script Graph

When working with large amount of scripts and non-linear stories, it could become handy to have some kind of visual representation of the story flow. This is where script graph tool comes in handy.

![](https://i.gyazo.com/0dd3ec2393807fb03d501028e1526895.mp4)

To open the graph window use `Naninovel -> Script Graph` editor menu. You can dock the window as any other editor panel if you like to.

The tool will automatically build graph representation of all the naninovel scripts (represented as nodes) assigned via editor resources (`Naninovel -> Resources -> Scripts`) and connections between them.

The connections are generated based on [@goto], [@gosub] and [@choice] (when it has a `goto` parameter) commands. If the command has a conditional expression assigned (`if` parameter), corresponding port in the node will be highlighted with yellow and you'll be able to see the expression when hovering the port.

You can select script asset and open visual editor by double-clicking nodes or clicking ports. Clicking the ports will also scroll the visual editor to a line containing label (in case there were a label specified).

You can re-position the nodes as you like and their positions will be automatically saved when closing the graph window or exiting Unity; the positions will then be restored when re-open the window. You can also save manually by clicking "Save" button. Clicking "Auto Align" button will reset all the positions.

When changing scripts or adding new ones, click "Rebuild Graph" button to sync it.

When [comment lines](/guide/naninovel-scripts#comment-lines) are present at the top of a script, associated graph node will show those as a synopsis. To disable that, uncheck `Show Synopsis` in the scripts configuration menu.

It's possible to edit scripts at play mode (via both visual and external editors) and have the changes applied immediately, without game restart. The feature is controlled via `Hot Reload Scripts` property in the scripts configuration and is enabled by default.

When modifying, adding or removing a line before the currently played one, state rollback will automatically happen to the modified line to prevent state inconsistency.

In case hot reload is not working, make sure `Auto Refresh` is enabled and `Script Changes While Playing` is set to `Recompile And Continue Playing`. Both properties can be found at `Edit -> Preferences -> General` Unity editor menu.

To manually initiate hot reload of the currently played naninovel script (eg, when editing script file outside of Unity project), use `reload` [console command](/guide/development-console). The command is editor-only (won't work in builds).

## IDE Support

IDE features, like syntax highlighting, error checking, auto-completion and interactive documentation could significantly increase productivity when writing scripts. We've made an extension for a free and open-source [VS Code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com) (available for Windows, MacOS and Linux), which provides the essential IDE support for NaniScript syntax.

For more information on how to install and use the extension see the [IDE extension guide](/guide/ide-extension).

## Scripts Debug

When working with large naninovel scripts, it could become tedious to always play them from start in order to check how things work in particular parts of the script.

Using [development console](/guide/development-console) you can instantly "rewind" currently played script to an arbitrary line:

```
rewind 12
```

— will start playing current script from the 12th line; you can rewind forward and backward in the same way. To open the console while game is running, make sure the console is enabled in the engine configuration and press `~` key (can be changed in the configuration) or perform multi-touch (3 or more simultaneous touches) in case the build is running on a touchscreen device.

To find out which script and line is currently playing, use debug window: type `debug` in the development console and press `Enter` to show the window.

![Scripts Debug](https://i.gyazo.com/12772ecc7c14011bcde4a74c81e997b8.png)

Currently played script path, line number and command (inline) index are displayed in the title of the window. When [auto voicing](/guide/voicing#auto-voicing) feature is enabled, name of the corresponding voice clip will also be displayed. You can re-position the window by dragging it by the title. "Stop" button will halt script execution; when script player is stopped "Play" button will resume the execution. You can close the debug window by pressing the "Close" button.

Debug window is available in both editor and player builds.

## Text Identification

Features like [script localization](/guide/localization#scripts-localization) and [auto voicing](/guide/voicing#auto-voicing) require associating text written in Naninovel scenario scripts with other resources; for example translated text to show instead of the associated one or voice clip to play when associated text is printed. For this to work we have to assign each such text a unique identifier.

By default, Naninovel will automatically identify all the localizable text by its content hash when importing script assets. This works fine as long as you don't modify the text; but after you do, all the associations will break: you'll have to re-map auto voice clips or re-translate changed text statements.

To prevent associations from breaking when editing text, enable `Stable Identification` under scripts configuration menu. When enabled, Naninovel will explicitly write unique IDs to each localizable text in imported scripts. The downside is that the script text will now have IDs appended to each localizable parameter, eg:

```nani
Kohaku: Hey!|#1|[i] What's up?|#2|
@choice "Option 1|#3|"
@choice "Option 2|#4|"
```

— but in return, as long as you don't remove or change the IDs, the associations won't break. To make text IDs less distracting, they are colored dim by the IDE extension and visual editor.

When stable identification is enabled, the system will also make sure all the generated text IDs are unique and were never used before inside the script document; for this, it'll store latest revision numbers in `NaninovelData/ScriptRevisions` editor asset. Whenever you remove a line with an assigned text ID, you can be sure that this ID won't suddenly appear in some other place (unless you specify it manually).

### Identified Text References

In some rare cases you may look to intentionally duplicate localizable text identifier. For example, when creating an instance of command in C#, which should re-use localized parameter specified in script.

Should you just assign `LocalizableTextParameter` parameter value, Naninovel will warn about duplicate text IDs. Instead, use `Ref()` instance method of the parameter:

```cs
var myPrintCommand = new PrintText();
myPrintCommand.AuthorLabel = printFromScript.AuthorLabel.Ref();
```

To reference an existing localized text inside scenario script, append `&` to the identifier:

```nani
; Show choice with "Some Text" and then print the same text.
@choice "Some Text|#SOMEID|"
@stop
@print |#&SOMEID|
```

## Fountain

[Fountain](https://fountain.io) is a markup syntax for writing, editing and sharing screenplays in plain, human-readable text. It's supported by the screenwriting software, such as [Highland](https://highland2.app), [Final Draft](https://www.finaldraft.com) and [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener).

![](https://i.gyazo.com/a4efc6cd882a12799f548ecf1dde4824.png)

Naninovel provides a tool to convert `.fountain` documents to `.nani` scripts, so that you can work on the initial scenario for your project in a Fountain-compatible software and then move to Naninovel.

Open the tool via `Naninovel -> Tools -> Fountain Screenplay` editor menu, select source `.fountain` document, output folder to store the generated `.nani` files and click "Convert Screenplay".

![](https://i.gyazo.com/2cf71e3a5b2713ba14838f1e28bb498d.png)

Fountain's [Action](https://fountain.io/syntax#section-action) and [Dialogue](https://fountain.io/syntax#section-dialogue) paragraphs will be converted to [generic text lines](/guide/naninovel-scripts.html#generic-text-lines); other syntax constructs will be represented as [comment lines](/guide/naninovel-scripts.html#comment-lines).

![](https://i.gyazo.com/e6d3231993fc11eb664d2c9a70c8a87a.png)

If you'd like to split the screenplay into multiple `.nani` scripts, use Fountain's [Section](https://fountain.io/syntax#section-sections) markup. For example, consider the following screenplay:

```
# Episode 1
## Scene 1
...
## Scene 2
...
# Episode 2
## Scene 1
...
```

It'll be converted in the following naninovel scripts, organized with folders:

- `Episode 1/Scene 1.nani`
- `Episode 1/Scene 2.nani`
- `Episode 2/Scene 1.nani`
