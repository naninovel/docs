# Configuration
The engine configuration is stored in multiple scriptable object assets located at `Assets/NaninovelData/Resources/Naninovel/Configuration` folder. They are automatically generated when opening the corresponding configuration menus in the Unity editor for the first time. 

Use `Naninovel -> Configuration` or `Edit -> Project Settings -> Naninovel` to access the configuration menu.

Notice, that all the configuration menus are supporting [Unity's presets feature](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Presets). It could be useful to create several configuration presets when deploying to different target platforms (eg, mobile, standalone, consoles, etc).

It's possible to modify configuration objects at runtime, add new custom configurations and change the way the objects are accessed at runtime (eg, read configuration from JSON files stored on a remote host); see [custom configuration](/guide/custom-configuration) guide for more information.

Expose Source Locale | True | Whether to make the source locale available to the end-users (players), ie included to the language selection.<br><br>Disabling this option can be useful in case you'd like to share the source localizable text with a third-party (eg, for proofreading), but don't want to share the scenario scripts. In which case, disable this option and add a dedicated locale for the source material, which can then be exported to the localization documents or spreadsheets.
Default Locale | Null | Locale selected by default when running the game for the first time. Will select `Source Locale` when not specified.

Annotation Prefix | >  | Text character to insert before annotation lines to distinguish them for the localized text. Annotations are comments optionally added to the generated localization documents to provide additional context for the translators, such as author of the printed text messages, inlined commands and command lines containing localized parameters.

## Resource Provider

<div class="config-table">

Property | Default Value | Description
--- | --- | ---
Resource Policy | Conservative | Dictates when the resources are loaded and unloaded during script execution:<br> • Conservative — The default mode with balanced memory utilization. All the resources required for script execution are preloaded when starting the playback and unloaded when the script has finished playing. Scripts referenced in [@gosub] commands are preloaded as well. Additional scripts can be preloaded by using `hold` parameter of [@goto] command.<br> • Optimistic — All the resources required by the played script, as well all resources of all the scripts specified in [@goto] and [@gosub] commands are preloaded and not unloaded unless `release` parameter is specified in [@goto] command. This minimizes loading screens and allows smooth rollback, but requires manually specifying when the resources have to be unloaded, increasing risk of out of memory exceptions.

Enable Build Processing | True | Whether to register a custom build player handle to process the assets assigned as Naninovel resources.<br><br>Warning: In order for this setting to take effect, it's required to restart the Unity editor.

Auto Build Bundles | True | Whether to automatically build the addressable asset bundles when building the player. Has no effect when `Use Addressables` is disabled.
Allow Addressable In Editor | False | Whether to use addressable provider in editor. Enable if you're manually exposing resources via addressable address instead of assigning them with Naninovel's resource managers. Be aware, that enabling this could cause issues when resources are assigned both in resources manager and registered with an addressable address and then renamed or duplicated.
Label By Scripts | True | Whether to label all the Naninovel addressable assets by the scenario script path they're used in. When `Bundle Mode` is set to `Pack Together By Label` in the addressable group settings, will result in a more efficient bundle packing.<br><br>Note that script labels will be assigned to all the assets with 'Naninovel' label, which includes assets manually exposed to the addressable resource provider (w/o using the resource editor menus).
Group By Category | False | Whether to create an addressable group per Naninovel resource category: scripts, characters, audio, etc. When disabled, will use single `Naninovel` group for all the resources.
Extra Labels | Null | Addressable provider will only work with assets, that have the assigned labels in addition to `Naninovel` label. Can be used to filter assets used by the engine based on custom criteria (eg, HD vs SD textures).
Local Root Path | %DATA%/Resources | Path root to use for the local resource provider. Can be an absolute path to the folder where the resources are located, or a relative path with one of the available origins:<br> • %DATA% — Game data folder on the target device (UnityEngine.Application.dataPath).<br> • %PDATA% — Persistent data directory on the target device (UnityEngine.Application.persistentDataPath).<br> • %STREAM% — `StreamingAssets` folder (UnityEngine.Application.streamingAssetsPath).<br> • %SPECIAL{F}% — An OS special folder (where F is value from System.Environment.SpecialFolder).

Show Debug On Init | False | Whether to show player debug window on engine initialization.
Wait By Default | False | Whether to wait the played commands when the `wait` parameter is not explicitly specified. Only applicable to the awaitable (asynchronous) commands.<br><br>WARNING: Don't enable in new projects, as this option is kept for backward compatibility and will be removed in the next release.
Show Loading UI | True | Whether to show `ILoadingUI` while a script is pre-/loaded. Allows masking resource loading process with the loading screen.
Resolve Mode | Nearest | The mode in which script player handles missing playback spots when loading state. This may happen when player saved a game amidst a scenario script, which is then changed (eg, via a game update) and the saved playback spot (line and inline indexes) is no longer available.<br> • Nearest — Attempt to play from the nearest next spot; in case no next spots found (script was made shorter), start from nearest previous one. Most forgiving mode, but could cause an undefined behaviour.<br> • Restart — Start playing current script from start. Won't cause undefined behaviour in case all the state is local to scenario script, but player will have to re-play the script form the start.<br> • Error — Throw an error. Choose this option in case undefined behaviour is not acceptable.
