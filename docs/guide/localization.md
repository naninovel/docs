# Localization

All the game resources (scripts, audio, voice, backgrounds, etc) can be localized to multiple languages/cultures.

Resources originally used to author the project are associated with *source locale* by default. For example, given the game is initially authored in English, all the original (source) naninovel scripts, UIs, signs on backgrounds, etc are in English; this means the *source locale* is `en` (or `en-GB` / `en-US` / etc in case you wish to use separate locales for specific regions).

The *source locale* can be changed via `Naninovel -> Configuration -> Localization` menu with `Source Locale` property. `Source Locale` property only determines the name (ID) of the locale associated with source project assets and is used in the "Language" drop-down settings menu and related engine APIs to distinguish the locale.

::: tip
In case you'd like to share the source localizable text with a third-party (eg, for proofreading), but don't want to share the source scenario scripts, change `Source Locale` to some unrelated language you won't actually need, then disable `Expose Source Locale` and add a dedicated locale for the source material, which can then be exported to the localization [documents](/guide/localization#scripts-localization) or [spreadsheets](/guide/localization#spreadsheet).
:::

To add a locale create sub-folder inside `Resources/Naninovel/Localization` (the so-called *localization resources root*) with a name equal to one of the [RFC5646](https://gist.github.com/Elringus/db90d9c74f13c00fa35131e61d1b73cb) language tags you wish to add localization for. For example, to add German locale, create `Resources/Naninovel/Localization/de` folder. The "Language" drop-down list in the game settings built-in UI will automatically incorporate all the added locales.

Be aware, that you don't have to create a sub-folder in the *localization resources root* for the *source locale*. All the project resources stored outside the *localization resources root* belong to the *source locale* by default.

*Localization resources root* specific path can be changed in the localization configuration menu via `Loader > Path Prefix` property. Notice, that the configured path is relative to a "Resources" folder (not the "Assets"). The resources folders are [handled in a special way](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LoadingResourcesatRuntime.html) by Unity; you can have multiple such folders stored anywhere inside the project assets for organization purposes.

::: tip
Like with any other type of resources, instead of using `Resources` folder you can opt for a different resource provider; for example, with [addressables](/guide/resource-providers#addressable) provider you can bundle locale-specific resources independently of the main game package and download them on-demand.
:::

## Default Locale

To specify which locale is selected by default when player first runs the game use `Default Locale` property in the localization configuration menu. When the property is not specified, the game will start in `Source Locale`.

When `Auto Detect Locale` option is enabled in the configuration and the game is running for the first time, Naninovel will attempt to automatically detect locale based on system language. When succeeds and the locale is supported by the game, it'll be selected; otherwise falls back to `Default Locale`.

::: warning
Automatically detected locale won't have specifier, ie when system language is English, the detected locale will be `en`, never `en-US` or `en-GB`. This is a limitation of Unity's [system language detection](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-systemLanguage). When relying on auto-detection, make sure to not use specifiers in the added locales.
:::

## Resources Localization

Inside the *localization resources root* store resources that will be used instead of the source ones when the corresponding localization is selected in the game settings.

For example, if you wish to replace a "City" appearance sprite of a main background (background actor with "MainBackground" ID) with another one when a `ja-JP` locale is selected, place the localized version at the following path: `Resources/Naninovel/Localization/ja-JP/Backgrounds/MainBackground/City`.

## Scripts Localization

The resources localization scheme described above works with all the resource types, except naninovel scripts and managed text documents. For these type of resources, use localization tool accessible via `Naninovel -> Tools -> Localization`:

![](https://i.gyazo.com/1b47d70dcbbb45a3ab955b44c9b50942.png)

First, pick `Scripts Folder (input)` — project directory where Naninovel scenario scripts (`.nani`) are stored (eg, `Assets/Scenario`). Optionally, to generate localization documents for [managed text](/guide/managed-text) as well, pick `Text Folder (input)` — directory where the managed text documents are stored (`Assets/Resources/Naninovel/Text` by default).

Alternatively, in case you wish to generate localization documents not on the source locale, but on a previously generated documents for another locale, instead of source scenario scripts folder pick text folder with existing localization documents for another locale, eg `Assets/Resources/Naninovel/Localization/ja-JP/Text`.

Then select path to the locale folder where to store the generated localization resources. Make sure you've selected an actual locale folder (eg, `Resources/Naninovel/Localization/ja-JP`). Label under the property field will indicate when a valid output locale folder is selected displaying name of the selected localization target.

::: tip
It's possible to generate resources for all the available locales in the project at once; select *localization resources root* directory instead of a specific locale folder and continue as usual. The tool will iterate the sub-folders of the selected directory and generate resources for each of them.

![](https://i.gyazo.com/4f0a6373755f0e122958f1f98de13013.png)
:::

Press "Generate" button to create (update) the localization resources. On consequent runs the tool will respect previously generated localization documents and preserve localized statements in case the source material has not changed.

Script localization documents are grouped under `Scripts` folder and consist of statements in the following format:

```nani
# ID
; Source text
Translation text
```

`# ID` line is the unique identifier of the localized content, you shouldn't modify those.

`; Source text` line is the original content which you're expected to translate. It's just a comment, so changing this line won't have any effect; it's provided for convenience.

You're expected to put the actual translation right after the comment line with the source text. You can use any number of lines for the translation for readability (they'll be joined), just make sure to place them before next `# ID` line:

```nani
# aj0e5dea
; Aliquam ut <b>ultricies</b> enim, id venenatis.<br>Nullam rhoncus eros tempus.
Оценивая блеск <b>металлического</b> шарика, пространство равноденственно.<br>
Противостояние есть метеорный дождь.
```

### Joined Lines

When translated generic line contains inlined commands or expressions, it'll be split into multiple text fragments, each mapped to unique text ID. When **Join Lines** option is enabled, such fragments will be joined into single line with pipe symbol `|`.

For example, given following source script text:

```nani
Looks like rain is starting[rain]. Hey, {MC}, hurry up!
```

— following localization document will be generated:

```nani
# id1|id2|id3
; Looks like rain is starting|. Hey, |, hurry up!
```

Notice inlined command and expression replaced with `|`. Remember to preserve them in the translated text:

```nani
# id1|id2|id3
; Looks like rain is starting|. Hey, |, hurry up!
Похоже, дождь начинается|. Эй, |, поспеши!
```

It's also possible to re-arrange localized text between fragments, if required by the target localization, eg:

```nani
# id1|id2
; Hey, |, hurry up!
|, эй, поспеши!
```
— this will print `{MC}` (main character name) before the rest of the sentence.

::: tip
To give translators more control over the inlined content, for example allow re-writing the actual commands or changing order of the expressions, check out [reveal events](/guide/text-printers#reveal-events) and [reveal expressions](/guide/text-printers#reveal-expressions).
:::

### Annotations

When **Include Annotations** option is enabled, generated localization documents will contain source script content being localized (command or generic line), as well as any comments placed before that. For example, given following source script text:

```nani
; Player has to pick route.
@choice "Go left" set:route="left"
@choice "Go right" set:route="right"
Narrator: You've decided to go {route}. Wise choice!
```

— following localization document will be generated:

```nani
# id1
; > Player has to pick route.
; > @choice "|#id1|" set:route="left"
; Go left

# id2
; > @choice "|#id2|" set:route="right"
; Go right

# id3|id4
; > Narrator: |#id3|{route}|#id4|
; You've decided to go |. Wise choice!
```

This may be useful to give translator more context on the localized text. Make sure to **NOT** include annotations (lines starting with `; >`) into the translation lines. Only localized text on the lines starting with single `;` is expected to be translated.

::: tip EXAMPLE
Find example localization setup in the [localization sample](/guide/samples#localization). Consider using it as a reference in case having issues setting up localization in your own project.

## Spreadsheet

At some point you may look for an option to compile all the project scenario script and managed text localizations into spreadsheets. For example, you may want to share the text with a translation agency or editors for proofreading.

Spreadsheet tool allows extracting all the localizable text from the project to `.csv` sheets and then import it back.

![](https://i.gyazo.com/50767f3193ae5b3ed423ea7c213c786b.png)

Before exporting the project data, always generate localization data with the localization tool (`Naninovel -> Tools -> Localization`). You can generate resources for all the locales defined in the project at once by selecting the localization root directory (`Resources/Naninovel/Localization` by default) for the `Locale Folder` property.

![](https://i.gyazo.com/047d43250a941b918de65205a19b2d78.png)

When the localization data is up-to-date, open spreadsheet tool with `Naninovel -> Tools -> Spreadsheet` editor menu.

![](https://i.gyazo.com/16cd076ebcc43b2d1a058c10e9dea43d.png)

Specify the required folders:
- Input Script Folder — folder where source naninovel scenario scripts (`.nani`) are stored, for example `Assets/Scenario`.
- Input Text Folder — folder where [managed text documents](/guide/managed-text) are generated to, for example `Assets/Resources/Naninovel/Text`. Make sure to generate managed text documents via associated tool in case the folder is missing.
- Input Localization Folder — localization root where resources for all the different locales are stored, for example `Assets/Resources/Naninovel/Localization`.
- Output Folder — folder where to store generated or import edited sheets from.

Click "Export" button to export sheets to the selected destination.

Each script and managed text document will be exported to an individual sheet. Each sheets will have "ID" column storing localizable text IDs and additional column per each locale. You're free to modify all the columns in the spreadsheet except "ID"; however, modifying column associated with the source locale won't have any effect on import.

When **Include Annotations** option is enabled, generated sheets will also contain a column with the source script content, such as author names, inlined commands and comments placed before localized lines. The column is ignored during import.

After performing required modifications, click "Import" button to import the data back to the project.

::: warning
Project's localization documents will be overwritten when importing from spreadsheet, so refrain from modifying them while the spreadsheet is being edited to prevent conflicts.
:::

### Custom Processor

It's possible to inject custom spreadsheet processor to customize the way sheets are generated as well as the import and export processes.

Create a custom processor class by inheriting built-in `Naninovel.Spreadsheet.Processor` handler. The utility will automatically pick the custom handler and use it instead of the built-in one.

Below is an example of a custom processor with some key override points.

```csharp
using Naninovel.Spreadsheet;

public class CustomProcessor : Processor
{
    public CustomProcessor (ProcessorOptions options) : base(options)
    {
        // Access export/import process options, eg:
        // options.ScriptFolder
        // options.SourceLocale
        // ...etc
    }

    // Override how scripts are exported from project to sheets.
    protected override void ExportScripts () { }
    // Override how managed text is exported from project to sheets.
    protected override void ExportText () { }
    // Override how script are imported from sheets to project.
    protected override void ImportText () { }
    // Override how managed text is imported from sheets to project
    protected override void ImportScripts () { }
}
```

## UI Localization

To localize both custom and built-in UIs, use [managed text provider](/guide/managed-text#managed-text-provider) component. It can also be used to localize any other custom game objects (prefabs). For more information on how to use managed text records and localize them, refer to the managed text guide.

## Fonts

To display text in some languages, you'll need a compatible font. [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) is used by default, which supports all Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek characters in Unicode 7.0.

::: tip
In case you're aiming to support multiple languages with a single font, check out [Noto fonts](https://www.google.com/get/noto/).
:::

Right-to-left (RTL) languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, etc) are supported by the TMPro text printers, but require additional setup; [see the guide](/guide/text-printers.html#right-to-left-arabic-text) for more info.

When publishing for CJK languages (Chinese, Japanese and Korean), consider using Character Extractor utility to optimize TMPro font atlases size. ([guide](/guide/text-printers.html#cjk-languages))

To associate a font with a specific locale, use `Apply On Locale` property of font options found in UI configuration. When a locale is selected, the font will be automatically applied when that locale is selected in the game settings.

![](https://i.gyazo.com/e44d120c983f3d6c1d15e910829fc344.png)

In order for the feature to work, make sure `Font Change Configuration` component is set up properly on the text printer. Find the instructions on setting up fonts in the [UI guide](/guide/user-interface#changing-font).

## Community Localization

When released title gains enough popularity, community (players) may look to contribute additional localizations; this often leads to users hacking build assets to replace the displayed text. Naninovel provides runtime localization option allowing to add community localizations without tampering with the build files.

### Ejecting Localization Resources

To generate localization resources (script and managed text docs), run the game executable with `-nani-eject` argument, eg:

```
./game.exe -nani-eject
```

— this will launch the game as usual, but after Naninovel is initialized, it will eject the localization resources to Unity's [persistent data folder](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-persistentDataPath.html) under `Localization` folder. For example, if the application's company is `Foo` and game title is `Bar` ejected path on Windows will be following: `C:/Users/User/AppData/LocalLow/Foo/Bar/Localization`.

If you'd like to generate localization resources based on a built-in localization, append the locale tag to the eject arg. Eg, given the game has `ja-JP` localization, use the following args to eject the Japanese localization documents: `-nani-eject-ja-JP`. When the locale tag is not specified, documents for the source locale are ejected.

Now supply a font to use with the localization. Drop the font file under the Localization directory, eg: `Localization/Noto.ttf`.

Notice the `Localization/Info.txt` file. Here you have to specify author of the localization (first line) and supplied font name (second line) by replacing the default content of the file. Here's an example:

```
Awesome Author
Noto.ttf
```

— "Awesome Author" will be displayed in the language dropdown by default, but developer may customize this behaviour. Font will be applied by default when the game is started.

Don't delete or move the `Info.txt` file, as it's required to detect presence of the community localization.

### Translating

After the documents are ejected you can start the translation. The process is similar to the "Scripts Localization" and "UI Localization" explained above. Script localization documents are stored at `Localization/Text/Scripts` folder, while managed text docs are stored at `Localization/Text`.

Restart the game as usual (without the eject arg) and it will automatically use the localization resources at the persistent data folder. For changes in script localization to take effect, associated script have to be re-loaded (save-loading is usually enough), but it may be required to restart the game in some cases.

In case developer updates the game, you can eject again to update the existing localization; new lines and records will be inserted, while existing translation for the unchanged source material will not be lost.

After the localization is finished, share the `Localization` folder and instruct end-users to place it under the aforementioned persistent data directory to activate the localization. To disable the localization, delete the folder.

## Compiler Localization

NaniScript is special among domain-specific languages in that it's heavily intertwined with natural languages, ie you have to constantly switch between typing prose displayed to the player, such as printed text lines and engine scripting constructs, such as commands and labels.

As long as you're authoring scenario in English, it's not a problem, but imagine scenario writer working in other language: they would have to constantly switch between layouts to input natural text in their language and command lines in English. Even worse, some keyboard layouts may not have required control keys, such as `@` used for commands, requiring writers to input them via key codes.

To help authoring scenarios in languages other than English, Naninovel has compiler localization feature. It allows re-mapping all the control characters, as well as command and parameter names, constants and basically anything you ever have to type when authoring the scenario.

First, create compiler localization asset via `Create -> Naninovel -> Compiler Localization` context menu. Select the asset and specify preferred localization to the compiler artifacts:

![](https://i.gyazo.com/5ffcd8e06231616598cc8317f7854f9a.png)

To override command, parameters, functions and constants, use dedicated lists. You can as well localize documentation and usage examples associated with commands and parameters. It will be shown in IDE extension.

![](https://i.gyazo.com/4fdcdcec7361a9ccbcc1012d842ef4ad.png)

The lists are initially empty. To populate them with commands and functions available in the project, use inspector context menu.

![](https://i.gyazo.com/cddd1981c5aef5f16da2052898c7a530.png)

After making required changes restart Unity editor and re-import scenario script assets in order for changes to take effect.

Localized artifacts will propagate to visual editor and [IDE extension](/guide/ide-extension), so you'll get auto-complete and on-hover documentation after syncing metadata.

![](https://i.gyazo.com/fde9998597ffedb8a025401bb2f71ce9.png)

Check the [compiler localization sample](/guide/samples#compiler-localization) where the compiler is localized to Russian language and keyboard layout.
