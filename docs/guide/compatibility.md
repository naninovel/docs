# Compatibility

## Unity Version

Supported Unity versions range: `2022.3.61 - 6000.0`

Only LTS releases in the range are supported. Any issues with the future Unity releases will be addressed in the next Naninovel releases. Compatible Unity versions for past releases are specified in the [release notes](https://pre.naninovel.com/releases).

## Platforms

Naninovel doesn't use any platform-specific APIs, precompiled native libraries, or third-party dependencies. As a result, the engine is expected to be compatible with all platforms Unity can target. However, this also means we don't utilize any native platform capabilities, so you may need to adapt some features for an optimal user experience on exotic platforms, such as VR/XR.

::: info NOTE
While Unity [supports game consoles](https://unity.com/how-to/develop-console-video-games-unity) (PlayStation, Xbox, Switch), the process can be challenging for smaller developers. If you're looking for a publishing partner, we recommend [Sometimes You](https://porting.games), which has a strong track record of bringing Naninovel projects to a wide range of platforms.

## Enter Play Mode

Naninovel supports disabling both `Reload Domain` and `Reload Scene` options under "Enter Play Mode Settings" category of the project settings. Disabling the options will make entering play mode take less time, especially in large projects.

## Render Pipelines

While it's possible to use Nanionvel with Unity's [scriptable render pipelines](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/render-pipelines.html) (both URP and HDRP), some built-in features may not work out of the box and we won't be able to provide any support in such cases; see [render pipelines guide](/guide/render-pipelines) for more information.

## Text

Legacy (uGUI) text component is not supported by any of the built-in UIs or associated APIs; [TextMesh Pro](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.textmeshpro.html) is used by default.

## Managed Stripping

"Medium" and "High" [managed bytecode stripping](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ManagedCodeStripping.html) profiles are not supported. Either disable the stripping or use the "Low" profile (selected by default).

## Exceptions

At least "Explicitly Thrown Exceptions Only" level is required for `Enable Exceptions` option in "Publishing Settings" (selected by default). The setting is only applicable for [WebGl builds](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-building). "None" level is not supported.
