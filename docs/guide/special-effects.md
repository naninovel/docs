# Special Effects

A number of built-in script commands are dedicated for various special effects. For example, [@shake] command shakes an actor:

```nani
; Shake 'Kohaku' actor
@shake Kohaku
```

Most effects can be parametrized:

```nani
; Shake 'Kohaku' once (instead of the default 3)
@shake Kohaku count:1
```

You can update the effect parameters without re-starting them:

```nani
; Start slowly shaking `Kohaku` actor in a loop
@shake Kohaku loop! power:0.1
Kohaku: It's rumbling!
; Shake 3 more times with an increased amplitude
@shake Kohaku count:3 power:0.8
```

Some effects are persistent by default and have to be explicitly stopped:

```nani
; Start the rain
@rain
; Stop the rain
@rain power:0
```

Read on for descriptions of the built-in effects and the ways to [add custom effects](/guide/special-effects#adding-custom-effects).

@spawn ShakeCamera params:,5,,,,,true,false
; Same with the dedicated command
@shake Camera count:5 hor! !ver
```

## Animate Actor

To animate (interpolate) specific actor parameters over a range of key frames, consider using [@animate] command as a "quick and dirty" solution.

![](https://i.gyazo.com/a0494329c713c4309a52d57d0b297bee.mp4)

::: info NOTE
Scenario scripts are not designed for any kind of animation specifications. Whenever possible, use dedicated solutions instead, like Unity's [Animator](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Animator.html) or third-party animation tools. You can incorporate any kind of animation solution with [layered](https://naninovel.com/guide/characters#layered-characters) and [generic](https://naninovel.com/guide/characters#generic-characters) actors; we also have built-in support for [Live2D](https://naninovel.com/guide/characters#live2d-characters) and [Spine](https://naninovel.com/guide/characters#spine-characters) actors.

```

## Adding Custom Effects

### Standalone Effects

You can add a custom standalone effect (implemented via a prefab, like the "Rain" and "Snow" built-in effects) by adding the effect prefab via spawn resources manager (`Naninovel -> Resources -> Spawn`) and using [@spawn] and [@despawn] commands:

![](https://i.gyazo.com/45b9d8fb51ffb368ff9f792221f10ca6.png)

For example, given there is a `Explosion.prefab` prefab assigned via the spawn manager, following commands will spawn and de-spawn (destroy) the prefab on scene:

```nani
@spawn Explosion
@despawn Explosion
```

Additional effect parameters can be specified with `params`:

```nani
@spawn Explosion params:Kohaku,3,true
```

::: tip
When building custom effects with multiple parameters, consider creating a [custom command](/guide/custom-commands) and inheriting it from `SpawnEffect`. This way you won't have to remember parameter positions in the `params` array and get auto-completion and type-checking when using [IDE extension](/guide/ide-extension):

```nani
@explode Kohaku power:3 smoke!
```
:::

The [@spawn] command also has transform parameters, allowing to spawn the object at a specific scene or world positions and with a specific rotation or scale, eg:

```nani
; Spawn Explosion 15% from the left border of the screen
; with x10 scale and rotated by 15 degrees over z-axis.
@spawn Explosion pos:15 scale:10 rotation:,,15
```

In case you have a lot of prefabs to spawn and it's inconvenient to assign them via editor menu, it's possible to just drop them at `Resources/Naninovel/Spawn` folder and they'll automatically be available in the scripts. You can additionally organize them with sub-folders, if you wish; in this case use forward slashes (`/`) when referencing them in naninovel scripts. Eg, prefab asset stored as `Resources/Naninovel/Spawn/Explosions/Boom01` can be referenced in scripts as `Explosions/Boom01`.

It's also possible to use [addressable asset system](/guide/resource-providers#addressable) to manually expose the resources. To expose an asset, assign address equal to the path you'd use to expose it via the method described above, except omit the "Resources/" part. Eg, to expose a "Boom01" prefab asset, assign the asset following address: `Naninovel/Spawn/Boom01`. Be aware, that addressable provider is not used in editor by default; you can allow it by enabling `Enable Addressable In Editor` property in resource provider configuration menu.

Check the built-in effect prefabs stored at `Naninovel/Prefabs/FX` for reference implementations.

### Camera Effects

If you wish to apply a custom [post-processing effect](https://assetstore.unity.com/?q=post%20processing&orderBy=1) (aka image effect or camera filter, like the "Digital Glitch" built-in effect) to the Naninovel camera, [create a camera prefab](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CreatingPrefabs.html), [add the required effect components](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingComponents.html) to the camera's object and assign the prefab to `Custom Camera Prefab` field in the camera configuration menu (`Naninovel -> Configuration -> Camera`).

![](https://i.gyazo.com/6024aac1d2665dd96915758cd5c09fde.png)

You can toggle (enable if disabled and vice-versa) the added components via naninovel scripts using `toggle` parameter and explicitly set the enabled state with `set` parameter of the [@camera] command. For example, let's assume you've added a "Bloom Image Effect" component to the camera object. First, find out what is the type name of the component; it's usually specified in the `Script` field of the component.

![](https://i.gyazo.com/73b7eabfe97ed84796cbe715b7dafc14.png)

In our case the component's type name is `BloomImageEffect`. Use the type name to toggle this component at runtime like follows:

```nani
@camera toggle:BloomImageEffect
```

You can toggle multiple components at once by delimiting the type names with commas:

```nani
@camera toggle:BloomImageEffect,Sepia,CameraNoise
```

And in case you want to explicitly enable or disable a component:

```nani
@camera set:BloomImageEffect.true,Sepia.false,CameraNoise.true
```

— will enabled `BloomImageEffect` and `CameraNoise` components, while disabling `Sepia`.

To toggle, disable or enable all the components attached to the camera object, use `*` symbol.

```nani
; Toggle all components
@camera toggle:*

; Disable all components
@camera set:*.false

; Enable all components
@camera set:*.true
```

The state of the currently enabled (and disabled) camera components will be automatically saved and restored on game save-loading operations.
